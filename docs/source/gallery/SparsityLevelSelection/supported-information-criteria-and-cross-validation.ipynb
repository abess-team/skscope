The choice of an appropriate information criterion depends on the nature of the specific problem, the characteristics of the data, and the preferences of the researcher. Generally, a smaller information criterion indicates a better model. Below, we will introduce some commonly used information criteria and provide examples of how to call them in `skscope`."
